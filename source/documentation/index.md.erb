# Introduction

Design patterns are evidence-based solutions to common design problems.

Following design patterns means you:

- avoid repeating work thatâ€™s already been done
- avoid making mistakes that others have already learned from
- build on the research and experience of teams across government
- make your service consistent with other government services


## How to use design patterns

Check available GOV.UK design patterns and use the ones that apply to your service as you build it.

You must start using design patterns as soon as you begin [making prototypes](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-prototypes).

## Creating or changing patterns

If research shows that none of the existing patterns meet the needs of your users, you can:

- adapt an existing pattern
- create a new pattern

You must publish your findings in the [design patterns wiki](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Design-patterns-0eUk1OdHvql).
